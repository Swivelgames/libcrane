A very simple library for locating OS-preferred directories for applications to use for various purposes (such as logging, temporary data, user scripts, etc). Currently only provides an OS X/Cocoa based implementation, but others should be forthcoming as the parent project needs to be tested on other platforms. Intended to be accessed through JNA, so the API is pretty simple and doesn't expose anything other than c-strings and ints.

The name is intended to be some kind of joke about "native" and "art" and "folders".

Do with this code as you please, with no guarantees about anything from me. But if you learned something, a shoutout would be appreciated.
